                        Cell, a divertimento in C

      An ncurses viewer for 2-d cellular automata, designed for nothing more than idle ammusment. Cellular automata are interesting (and, at sufficent speed, dare I say "trippy"), ncurses is rather unloved in the modern era, and I don't write enough C...
      Given the rather offhand nature of this project, portability isn't a huge concern, and it's simple enough as to be self-documenting. However, it should run on most little-endian unix machines - the ioctl for terminal size is the the least portable thing, and that's supported on Linux and BSDs - and the -h option provides enough help.
